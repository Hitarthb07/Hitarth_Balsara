Black Friday Sales Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes a Black Friday sales dataset using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract meaningful insights from customer purchasing behavior.

  Objective

- Clean the dataset by handling missing values.
- Compute statistical summaries such as mean product category values.
- Identify unique users, product IDs, and age group distributions.
- Visualize key trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

  Dataset

The dataset contains transaction records from a Black Friday sale, including user demographics, product categories, and purchase amounts.

  Key Steps in Analysis

1.  Data Cleaning 
   - Removed columns with excessive missing values.
   - Checked for duplicate entries and inconsistencies.
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis 
   - Computed the mean of Product Category 1.
   - Identified unique users, product IDs, and age groups.
   - Generated summary statistics.
3.  Visualization 
   - Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze trends in sales and customer behavior.

  Results & Insights

- Certain product categories had significantly higher purchases.
- The dataset contained a wide range of unique users and product IDs, indicating diverse consumer interest.
- Age distribution and purchasing trends were analyzed to understand customer segmentation.
